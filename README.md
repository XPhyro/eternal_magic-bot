# Summary
This project helps Eternal Magic players by automatising some of the parts of the game. 

# *finance*
You can use finance.py to automatically go to the next finance quest NPC while you use the computer freely.

# *red-to-blue*
You can use red-to-blue.py to solve the red-to-blue puzzles in the instance named "Twins Room", in which you can enter by doing plague investigations or shrines, ie. stars, that are scattered around the different maps.

# Usage
This project is written and tested with Python 3.7.6. To get the best results, it is recommended that you use the tested version.

You can also grab the latest executable files from the releases tab if you would like an easier but less customisable option.

Note that it is recommended to use a Python interpreter, rather than using the provided executable forms as the executable forms have problems when multiprocessing is used.
